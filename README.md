# üìö Online Bookstore SQL Data Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview:

This project focuses on performing SQL-based data analysis on an **Online Bookstore Database**.  
I designed the database schema, loaded sample data from CSV files, and performed multiple SQL queries for business insights.

The project covers **customer behavior**, **book sales analysis**, **inventory management**, and **order trends**.
